<h1>What is the JAMstack?</h1>
<div class="word-box">
  <p>
    When we talk about “The Stack”, we no longer talk about operating systems,
    specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases. The
    Jamstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building
    websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower
    cost of scaling, and a better developer experience. Pre-rendered sites can
    be enhanced with JavaScript and the growing capabilities of browsers and
    services available via APIs.

  <p>
    You may have already seen or worked on a Jamstack site! They do not have to
    include all attributes of JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. They might be built
    using sites built by hand, or with Scully, Jekyll, Hugo, Nuxt, Next, Gatsby,
    or another static site generator... The thing that they all have in common
    is that they don’t depend on a web server.
